<p>Vous connaissez certainement différentes libraries pour afficher des données géographiques telles que <code>ggmap</code> et<code>choroplethr</code>. Bien que ces libraries fournissent de nombreuses fonctionnalités intéressantes pour mieux présenter les informations avec des graphes 2D, ils leur manquent encore une caractéristique importante : l’interactivité. Voici “leaflet” - une librairie écrit en javascript pour gérer les cartes interactives. Fait amusant : il est activement utilisé par de nombreux grands journaux, tels que le New York Times ou le Washington Post.</p>

<p>Ici, nous pouvons voir que toutes les écoles privées à New York ont été tracées sur une carte que l’on peut zoomer et dézoomer. Les marqueurs sont utilisés pour indiquer l’emplacement de chaque école. Si nous survolons un marqueur, il affiche le nom de l’école. Trop cool, non ?!</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">18.4</span> Heatmaps dynamiques</h2>
<p>Les Heatmaps sont des outils vraiment utiles pour visualiser la distribution d’une variable particulière sur une région donnée (ils sont si utiles que <a href="heatmap.html">nous avons une page sur eux</a>). Dans cet exemple, nous voyons comment <code>leaflet</code> est capable de calculer dynamiquement le nombre d’écoles dans une région donnée à partir de données de latitude et de longitude uniquement. Vous pouvez en faire l’expérience en effectuant un zoom avant ou arrière dans le graphique.</p>
