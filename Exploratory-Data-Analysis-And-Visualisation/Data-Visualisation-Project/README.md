Many analyses have been done on movie datasets but few of them were focused on specific questions. Through our analysis we wish to answer 3 major questions.

- Are movie production studios looking at the old patterns of movie genres and their financial success and are trying to replicate their success by making more movies of similar genre?

- Is Martin Scorseseâ€™s recent claim about the superhero movies right (https://variety.com/2019/film/news/martin-scorsese-marvel-theme-parks-1203360075/) ? If yes then what is the possible solution?

 - How have the most bankable directors of the older generation been performing in the past 2 decades? Who among them is the most versatile and most profitable?
 
The entire analysis was done in R. The preprocessing was done in R and Python.

Context for question 2: Martin Scorsese recently claimed that the superhero movies have been taking over the theaters and are overshadowing other good movies that released during the same time. He said he feels that they are like these amuzement parks and not like the cinema he grew up loving. This opinion caused a lot of raised eyebrows.

Conext for question 3: The bankability of the directors (in our analysis) is measured by the revenues their movies generated. The higher the revenue, higher the bankability.
