# Manually curated movie dataset analysis

There have been many analysis done on movie datasets but almost none of them were focused on specific questions they tried to answer. Through our analysis we wish to answer/test 3 major questions.
They are:

Are movie production houses looking at the old patterns of movie genres and their financial success and are trying to replicate their success by making more movies of similar genre?

Is Martin Scorseseâ€™s recent claim about the superhero movies right? If yes then what is the possible solution?

How have the most bankable directors of the older generation been performing in the past 2 decades? Who among them is the most versatile and most profitable?

Context for question 2: Martin Scorsese recently claimed that the superhero movies have been taking over the theaters and are overshadowing other good movies that released during the same time. He said he feels that they are like these amuzement parks and not like the cinema he grew up loving. This opinion caused a lot of raised eyebrows.

Conext for question 3: The bankability of the directors (in our analysis) is measured by the revenues their movies generated. The higher the revenue, higher the bankability.

To look at the final results please see the Analysis and Results section. It has a html file which contains our entire analysis and findings.
