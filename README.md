# Columbia
Things I studied at Columbia.

Looks like Columbia is more sensitive about us sharing our work than Telecom. This repo contains a few group projects that are already publicly available, as well as some labs instructors authorized us to share. In the mean time, you might find some useful code in the Telecom folder.

Courses:

* Algorithms for Data Science - CSORW4246 (private)
* Machine Learning for Image Analysis - STATGR5293 (private)
* Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization - STATW5702 (some projects available)
* Statistical Inference and Modeling - STATGR5703 (private)
* Machine Learning - COMSW4721 (private)
* Computer Systems for Data Science - COMSW4121 (private)
* Applied Machine Learning - COMSW4995_011 (all courses and labs available : https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s20/schedule/)
* Causal Inference - COMSW4995_013 (private)
